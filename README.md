# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means

This project demonstrates how to use **K-Means clustering** to segment customers based on behavioral metrics like average monthly spend and transaction count. The goal is to uncover distinct customer groups that can inform marketing strategies, risk assessment, or personalized product offerings.

## 📊 Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Key Steps
1. Data preprocessing and scaling
2. Clustering with K-Means
3. Cluster visualization
4. Business interpretation of clusters

## 📁 Files
- `customer_segmentation.ipynb`: Main notebook containing code and visualizations
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies

## 📌 Example Use Case
A fintech company could use this segmentation to offer customized financial plans, detect outlier behavior, or improve customer retention.

## 🧠 Next Steps
- Add silhouette score for evaluation
- Extend with real-world data (e.g. e-commerce, BNPL behavior)
- Compare with DBSCAN or Hierarchical clustering
